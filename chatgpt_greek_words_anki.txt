**User Objective:**  
For each Greek word provided, perform a structured lookup and deliver a clean, copy-friendly response.
The prompt will be used for creating Anki cards. The goal is to output 2 code blocks - the front and the back of the card.
The cards' user is an intermediate Greek learner. The back of the card should be mostly in Greek.

### Response Requirements
IMPORTANT: process the requirements in order and "out loud". Output relevant search results first without the code blocks and with the references, then output the blocks - do not use references in the boxes.

1. **Mandatory lookup**  
   - Verify **dictionary form**, **definition**, **etymology**, and **examples** using primarily **el.wiktionary.org**.  
   - Normalize any inflected forms to the **standard lemma**.  
   - If the input is a **phrase** (e.g. “μπας και”), keep it unchanged.  
   - Provide the exact source URL (never inside code blocks).  

2. **Dictionary-form block**  
   Present the lemma in a first code block:  

   \`\`\`
   <standard dictionary form>
   \`\`\`

   * **Nouns:** definite article + nominative singular (e.g. \`η τελετή\`, \`ο αγώνας\`, \`το παιδί\`)  
   * **Adjectives:** masculine nominative singular form first, triple endings with hyphens (e.g. \`καλός -ή -ό\`) **without article**  
   * **Verbs:** 1st person singular present indicative (e.g. \`γράφω\`, \`διασκορπίζομαι\`)  
   * **Other parts of speech:** lemma as listed in dictionaries (e.g. \`ψηλαφιστά\`)  
   * Always use the **standard dictionary form**, even if the input is an inflected form.

   NOTE: If the input is an inflected form, always normalize to the standard lemma (e.g. αλλεπάλληλες → αλλεπάλληλος -η -ο, εξιχνιάσει → εξιχνιάζω).

3. **Definition / Etymology / Usage block** 
   Keep the etymology brief and in Greek, not overly scholarly.
   Always mention if it’s from Ancient Greek, Katharevousa, or a compound (e.g. συνταρακτικός < συνταράσσω + -τικός).

   Present this information in a second code block:  

   \`\`\`
   <meaning in Greek, only write the meaning here, DO NOT add things like "(verb)" or "(noun)" here!>

   Etymology: <Explanation of roots, origin, compounds, and historical development in Greek.>

   English translation: <translations in English>

   Usage:
   • <Greek sentence>  
     <English translation>
   \`\`\`




4. **Source line**  
   Immediately after the code blocks add:  

   **Source:** <https://el.wiktionary.org/wiki/<word>>  

   If further citations are needed, list them **after** the source line using standard citation format — never inside code blocks.
